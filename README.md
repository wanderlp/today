### Notes

1. View controllers act as bridge between views and your data models. Each view controller is responsible for managing a view hierarchy, updating the content in views, and responding to events in the user interface.

2. The initial view controller value determines which view controller loads when the app loads the storyboard.

3. Apps may have multiple storyboards. The Main Interface setting in the app's project file determines which storyboard the app loads when it launches.

4. The `#if DEBUG` flag is a compilation directive that prevents the enclosed code from compiling when you build the app for release. You can use this flag for testing code in debug builds - or for providing sample test data.

5. Type aliases are helpful for referring to an existing type with a name that's more expressive.

6. Use implicitly unwrapped optionals only when you know that the optional will have a value. Otherwise, you risk triggering a runtime error that inmediately terminates the app. (ie: `var dataSource: DataSource!`)

7. Diffable data sources manage the state of your data with snapshots. A snapshot represents the state of your data at a specific point in time. To display data using a snapshot, you'll create the snapshot, populate the snapshot with the state of data that you want to display, and then apply the snapshot in the user interface.

8. The `@objc` attributes makes the method available to Objective-C code.

9. `Target-Action` is a design pattern in which an object hodls the information necessary to send a message to another object when an event ocurrs. In the Today App, the `touch UpInside` event occurs when a user taps the done button, which sends the `didPressDoneButton: sender` message to the view controller.

10. VoiceOver alerts users when actions are available for an object. If a user decides to hear the options, VoiceOver reads the name of each action.

11. `Class Inheritance and Initialization` indicates that a Swift subclass must call one of its superclass' designated initializers during initialization. ie: calling `super.init()`

12. Diffable data sources that supply UIKit lists with data and styling require that items conform to `Hashable`. The diffable data source uses the hash value to determine what changed between two snapshots of the data.
